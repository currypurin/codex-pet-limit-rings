# Codex Pet Limit Rings

Codex Pet Limit Rings is a native macOS companion app for Codex pets. It does not patch Codex, replace pet art, or modify the Codex app bundle. It follows the current pet with a transparent always-on-top window and exposes its own menu-bar icon.

The rings are pet-agnostic. They work with any pet Codex displays because the app tracks the pet window bounds rather than reading, editing, or understanding the pet artwork.

## Experience Contract

- A rings icon appears in the macOS menu bar.
- `Show Rings` toggles the overlay without quitting the app.
- `Ring Colors` selects separate outer-ring and inner-ring presets for the current pet.
- `Ring Opacity` selects separate outer-ring and inner-ring opacity presets for the current pet.
- `Refresh Now` rereads usage and pet-position state.
- Hovering over the ring or pet shows exact remaining percentages and reset timing.
- Dragging the pet makes the rings follow the gesture immediately while Codex persists the new position.
- Closing the Codex pet hides the rings.
- Multi-display positioning uses the screen containing the pet bounds, not the currently focused screen.
- macOS desktop/Space switching keeps the rings visible with the pet rather than tying them to one active desktop.
- Switching to another Codex pet requires no extra setup; the overlay follows the active pet.

## Data Flow

The app reads live usage first, then local files as support or fallback:

- `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage`: live usage endpoint, called with the local ChatGPT access token from `~/.codex/auth.json`.
- `~/.codex/auth.json`: local ChatGPT auth token used for the live usage call.
- `~/.codex/.codex-global-state.json`: current pet bounds, using `electron-avatar-overlay-bounds.mascot`.
- `electron-avatar-overlay-open` in the same state file: whether the Codex pet is currently open.
- `electron-persisted-atom-state.selected-avatar-id` in the same state file: current pet id used to remember ring color presets per pet.
- `~/.codex/logs_2.sqlite`: fallback source using the newest `codex.rate_limits` event when the live usage call fails.

The app watches `~/.codex/.codex-global-state.json` with a macOS file event source, so pet open/close and position writes trigger an immediate frame update. A slow frame timer remains as a fallback in case the file is replaced or an event is missed.

No OpenAI API key is required. The menu summary says `Live` when the direct usage read succeeds and `Cached` when it is showing the local event-log fallback.

## Rendering Model

- Outer ring: short-window remaining percentage.
- Inner ring: weekly remaining percentage.
- Healthy ring colors come from the selected outer-ring and inner-ring presets for the current pet. Built-in presets include Default, Sakura, Amber, Purple, and Brown.
- Outer and inner ring opacity come from separate presets for the current pet.
- Ring colors still move to amber for low capacity and red for critical capacity.
- Exact percentages and reset timing are shown only on hover to keep the pet feeling ambient rather than dashboard-like.
- Additional model-limit buckets may appear as small outer markers when available.

Color and opacity presets are saved in the app's macOS defaults domain using the selected pet id as part of the key. Outer and inner ring choices are stored separately. If a pet has no saved preset, the app falls back to the default preset. Older single-color-preset settings are still read as a compatibility fallback. They do not modify Codex pet assets or the Codex app bundle.

## Install Contract

`tools/install-limit-rings.sh` builds:

```text
~/Applications/CodexPetLimitRings.app
```

and installs:

```text
~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.codex-pet.limit-rings.plist
```

The LaunchAgent starts the app at login. The installer also removes the earlier prototype app and LaunchAgent names if present:

```text
~/Applications/CodexLimitAura.app
~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.codex-pet.limit-aura.plist
```

`tools/uninstall-limit-rings.sh` unloads the LaunchAgent, removes the app bundle, clears saved app preferences including pet color presets, and also cleans up those earlier prototype names.

## Development

Build and run the app from the repository:

```bash
tools/run-limit-rings.sh
```

Render a static preview:

```bash
swiftc tools/codex-pet-limit-rings.swift -o tmp/codex-pet-limit-rings -framework AppKit -lsqlite3
tmp/codex-pet-limit-rings --preview tmp/limit-rings-preview.png --size 164
```

## Codex Skill

The repository includes a skill at `skills/codex-pet-limit-rings/`. Copy that folder into `~/.codex/skills/` or run `tools/install-codex-skill.sh` to make Codex auto-discover the workflow in future sessions.

The skill intentionally points agents at the companion-app boundary and validation commands. It should not encourage app-bundle patching as the default path.
